# Xmas Wish List
## Send your wishes to Santa

### **_Introduction_**
This fun side project needed to wait 6 months. I came up with the idea during Chrsitmas in 2021, but that time my knowledge was really nowhere. I just started to dig in to web development. Luckily I always make a list filled up with plans and dreams for the future. This little project was on it and it came the day when it got ready. 

### **_Project itself_** 
 I wanted to make a simple "To Do List" kind of thing, just in Xmas edition.

 ### **_Used Technologies_**
 1. HTML
 2. CSS/SASS
 3. Tailwind CSS
 4. Animate.css animation library
 5. JavaScript

**Aim of the Project**

First goal was to get to know Tailwind CSS within this simple project. It offers way more options and classes than Bootstrap 5. 
Secondary goal was practice DOM manipulation with JS.
Thirdly refresh my CSS animation and get to know an animation library.

**Challenges within the Project**

1. Using Tailwind CSS. It is really different to shape an input field or a button just with "small" classes. Really different from Bootstrap 5, where there is a btn class and "that's it". I am looking forward to use Tailwind CSS more as it can offers more mixing option within the classes.
2. DOM manipulation. Always good and challenging to practice DOM manipulation with JS. There is still a mistake in the project I need to figure out in the future (namely deleteing list items should allow to add new items after reaching 3 items on the list).

## **_What have I learned_**
Tailwind CSS and Tailwind CSS. Plus animation and DOM.

## Deployed: 2022. July.
